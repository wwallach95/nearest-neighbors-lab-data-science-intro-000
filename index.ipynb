    "In this lab, you apply nearest neighbors technique to help a taxi company predict the length of their rides.  Imagine that we are hired to consult for LiftOff, a limo and taxi service that is just opening up in NYC.  Liftoff wants it's taxi drivers to target longer rides, as the longer the ride the more money it makes.  LiftOff has the following theory:\n",

    "* the pickup location of a taxi ride can help predict the length of the ride.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LiftOff asks us to do some analysis to write a function that will allow it to **predict the length of a taxi ride for any given location **.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our technique will be the following:\n",
    "  * **Collect** Obtain the data containing all of the taxi information, and only select the attributes of taxi trips that we need \n",
    "  * ** Explore ** Examine the attributes of our data, and plot some of our data on a map\n",
    "  * ** Train ** Write our nearest neighbors formula, and change the number of nearby trips to predict the length of a new trip\n",
    "  * ** Predict ** Use our function to predict trip lengths of new locations"
